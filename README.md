# breakify.js
A simple JS script to break a list of sections into pages, with URL support to allow sharing of a specific page.

Javascript is evolving, therefore this script is written in Vanilla JS just for the sake of avoiding frameworks at least once. Older browsers and cross-browser support is not a point either.
